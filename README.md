# CodeEvolution-TemplateDrivenForms

**This codesbase is for Angular Template Driven Forms created with help of CodeEvolution Youtube series on Angular.**

Angular Provides 2 types of Forms(atleast when i was coding this) as below:-

**1.** _**Template Driven Forms<br />**_
**2.** _**Model Driven Forms**_

This code contains only template driven forms. I will implement Model Driven forms later.


Checkout the code and try to hit ``` http://localhost:4200 ``` to check the forms.
